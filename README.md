Prediction of the number of tickets sold of FC Inter using ARIMA model
I collected the data of every home match of FC Inter from season 2006-2007 until season 2021-2022. My aim is to create a model to predict the number of tickets sold in the last season. First of all i made some tests for stationarity and for correlation, then i removed the structural break due to the covid pandemic (no tickets sold beacuse of the closing of stadium) because it could effect my estimates and at the end, after splitting the entire dataset in train and test i found the best arima model and with it i created a prediction interval of 95%.
